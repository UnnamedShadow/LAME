# LAME
Language Agnostic Macro Engine - provides simple macro based file (code, audio, text, binary, etc.) building independent of any one programming language

you can use lib `lame` in rust or additionally use `lame.h` generated by `cargo run --bin lame-headers --features h` to build your own macros
if you want to build files based on templates `cargo run <files>`
the templates should be in the same directory as the file and be named like `<file>.lame`
